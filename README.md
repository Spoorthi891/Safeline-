# Safeline
It is a chat hotline which provides a safe space for women.
It shows the womans realtime location to the local police station and the assigned contacts.
While this app is installed, it shows a notification "Error" when the person tries to turn off the location services manually.
If the phone gets switched off, an alert is sent to the primary contacts.
If the phone stays switched off, an alert is sent to the secondary contacts after 6-7 hours.
In case the person is declared missing, their last location and location history will be handy to the police department. 
This might be helpful in reducing the time taken to find the missing person.
